= Camunda RUN Delegate Generator Example

If you want to use camunda java delegates with Camunda Run you must generate the delgates in a seperate jar project (in java world known as a library) and put them in the userlib directory.

``<project-hom>/configuration/userlib``

== Generate the lib
 TIP: Use maven to generate the jar file.

1. Go to the project home directory and

2. run the maven command.

``mvn clean package``

3. You should see a jar file in the director `target\<project-name.jar>`

4. move the jar file to the userlib directory in your Camunda Run install.

== Caveat you must use the fully qualified class name in your BPMN model
NOTE: TODO figure out how to use a spring bean instead of class name.
