# Camunda Spring Boot Application
Spring Boot Application using [Camunda](http://docs.camunda.org).

This project has been generated by the Maven archetype
[camunda-archetype-spring-boot-7.11.1](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/user-guide/process-applications/maven-archetypes/).


## How does it work?

This project showcases how a process definition can be created from a json configuration. The json configuration might come from an external system where no BPMN knowledge is needed to create a simple workflow. This demo only uses UserTasks. 

## How to use it?
Start the application by running `com.camunda.demo.CamundaApplication`. See options for that below.

Send a POST request to `http://localhost:8080/model` containing the content of `src/test/resources/example-config.json` as payload.
The process will be created and automatically deployed to the engine.


### Unit Test
You can run the JUnit test [InMemoryH2Test](src/main/resources/archetype-resources/src/test/java/ProcessTest.java) in your IDE or using:
```bash
mvn clean test
```

### Running the application
You can also build and run the process application with Spring Boot.

#### Manually
1. Build the application using:
```bash
mvn clean package
```
2. Run the *.jar file from the `target` directory using:
```bash
java -jar target/Camunda Spring Boot Application.jar
```

For a faster 1-click (re-)deployment see the alternatives below.

#### Maven Spring Boot Plugin
1. Build and deploy the process application using:
```bash
mvn clean package spring-boot:run
```

#### Your Java IDE
1. Run the project as a Java application in your IDE using CamundaApplication as the main class.

### Run and Inspect with Tasklist and Cockpit
Once you deployed the application you can run it using
[Camunda Tasklist](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#tasklist)
and inspect it using
[Camunda Cockpit](http://docs.camunda.org/latest/guides/user-guide/#cockpit).

## Environment Restrictions
