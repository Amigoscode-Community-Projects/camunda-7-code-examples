# On-demand Call Activity Plugin
A Plugin for [Camunda BPM](http://docs.camunda.org) that allows to skip the invocation of a sub-process.

This project has moved to it's own repository: [https://github.com/camunda-consulting/on-demand-call-activity](https://github.com/camunda-consulting/on-demand-call-activity)

There you can see how to run the complete test suite of the process engine against the process engine plugin.
